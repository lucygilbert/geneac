# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Preamble

First things first, it should be noted that this project is solely my own
work and not the work of whatever my current employer is, and similarly,
the views expressed in this file are my own.

I (Mitchell Rysavy, @mrysav) added this code of conduct in the fall of 2020 in order to
make sure I had my ducks in a row for Hacktoberfest. Clearly, I used a template.

I stand by the contents of this file, but I want to state my intentions a
bit more clearly here. Codes of Conduct have become something of a
lightning rod in the open source community over the last few years, and
while I am the main (and often only) contributor to this repository,
if anyone else wants to contribute I want them to know what to expect.

Be nice. I am the [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life)
of Geneac and I _strongly_ want others to contribute, but at the end of the day
I make Geneac for my own benefit, and I don't want to deal with a lot of
conflict.

My pledge to you is to do my best at bringing my best self to whatever PRs
or comments you have. If I do something that you regard as undeserved hostility,
you are free to call that out. If I violate any of the below conduct guidelines
myself that demonstrate non-inclusive behavior, I _absolutely_ want to know about
it and you can either call it out or email me privately at mitchell.rysavy@gmail.com

Thank you for understanding. And thank you for using or contributing to Geneac!

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

- Using welcoming and inclusive language
- Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
- Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
  advances
- Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
  address, without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
  professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at mitchell.rysavy@gmail.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
